# Front End Project-Furry Friend Finder 

This app will work on all of the Front-End concepts that we have conducted up to this point. 

The premise of the app will be to allow users to search through different dog breeds in an input window which will conduct an AJAX call to THE DOG API and return the searched results. 

Once user has selected the type of breed it would like they will be able to search to see if that type of breed of dog is available for adoption
