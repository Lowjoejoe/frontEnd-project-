# Front End Project-Furry Friend Finder 

This app will work on all of the Front-End concepts that we have conducted up to this point. 

The premise of the app will be to allow users to search through different dog breeds in an input window which will conduct an AJAX call to THE DOG API and return the searched results. 

     Feature 1: allows user to search the dog by typing it into an input box and it will predictavely determine what breed is being typed in and return closest match 
     Feature 2: allows user to use the selector to select a breed from the drop down menu and it will load the breeds photo and data
     Feautre 3: allows user to clear search and return the page to blank 

     future features: loading all dog breeds initally for viewing by the user

Once user has selected the type of breed it would like they will be able to search to see if that type of breed of dog is available for adoption
